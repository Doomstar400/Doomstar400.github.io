### CPSC 120

* [Lab 2](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-01-damon-godfrey)

    Lab 1, was a favorite because it was a great introduction into programming. We did a output code of "Hello World" which was awesome. It is a very popluar code a lot of programmer do first and do that was pretty fun even though it was not anything complicated

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-05-gman-team/tree/main/part-1)

    Lab 5, part 1 was another one of my favorite because it was a fun bit of coding.We were able to take user inputs and turn into a little funny mad lib. This lab really had use using what we had learn from class in real code.

* [Lab 3](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-03-damon-and-godfrey/tree/main/part-2)

    Lab 3, part 2 was my last favorite because it was a challenge and really made you have to think on the math and the logic. This was a lab were you really had to debug your code for logic error. Overall this lab was really fun and a great brain teaser.
